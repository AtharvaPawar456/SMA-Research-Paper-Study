Hello and welcome to this insightful PDF file on the discourses of streaming success within the television industry, focusing on Netflix original series Fauda and La Casa de Papel. This article explores how Netflix is redefining successful television while addressing traditional industry challenges. Enjoy the read!

- Abstract:
This article examines the discourses of streaming success within the television industry by
focusing on Netflix and two of the service’s original series: Fauda and La Casa de Papel.
Using publicly available secondary data through 2019, this analysis argues the transnational
platform’s efforts to redefine successful television while maintaining a high level of data
secrecy necessitate the discursive construction of a global and undifferentiated audience.
Yet, rather than representing a break with the past, the discourses of streaming success
reveal Netflix to be a television institution attempting to address traditional industry
challenges.
