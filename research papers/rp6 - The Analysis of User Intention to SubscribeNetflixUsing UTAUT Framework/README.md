RP - 6 : The Analysis of User Intention to SubscribeNetflixUsing UTAUT Framework
   - link: 



- Abstract:
   
In addition to assessing the degree of satisfaction with the services offered by the streaming
application to its customers, this study seeks to identify the elements that motivate streaming
application users in Indonesia to renew their subscriptions in the coming months. The
research model employed in this study is the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of
Technology 2 (UTAUT2), which also includes variables for content, ethics, and morality in
addition to the variables for the expectation-confirmation model (ECM), specifically
satisfaction and intention to continue. This study uses a quantitative method with data
analysis using the PLS-SEM method with the help of SmartPLS. According to the study's
findings, a number of factors influence how likely users of streaming applications are to renew
their subscriptions in the months to come, including content, performance expectations,
facilitating conditions, hedonic incentive, price value, habit, morals, and ethics. The findings
of this study are anticipated to be taken into account when streaming applications decide
whether or not to expand in Indonesia

   
**Findings of the Research Paper:**
1. Factors influencing users' likelihood to renew subscriptions include content, performance expectations, facilitating conditions, hedonic incentive, price value, habit, morals, and ethics.
2. Hedonic motivation has the strongest influence on user satisfaction, followed by habit and price value.
3. Satisfaction is the most influential factor on continuance intention, followed by habit, morals, and ethics.
4. Streaming application users in Indonesia have shown a significant increase in numbers over the years.
5. The study uses the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) model to predict consumer use intentions towards technology.
6. The research employs a quantitative method with data analysis using the PLS-SEM method.
7. The study population was set at 426,200 users, with a sample size of 500 users selected randomly.
8. Data collection methods included literature review, surveys, and questionnaires.
9. The study findings are expected to guide streaming applications in decision-making regarding expansion in Indonesia.
10. All relationships between variables in the study were statistically positive and significant in measuring user loyalty towards streaming applications.

**Tools Used:**
1. Microsoft Word 2016 for writing reports.
2. Microsoft Excel for classifying questionnaire data.
3. SmartPLS for data processing.
4. Draw.io for creating supporting images.
5. Mendeley Desktop for managing references.

**Social Media Platform Used for Study:**
The study did not mention any specific social media platform used for research purposes.

**Algorithm:**
The research paper does not mention the use of any specific algorithm.

**Research Strategy:**
The research employed a quantitative approach with hypothesis testing through experimental research to analyze the impact of independent variables on user behavior towards streaming application subscriptions.

**Applications of the Study:**
The findings of this study can be applied by streaming applications to understand user behavior, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance strategies for subscription renewal and expansion in Indonesia.

**Summary of the Paper:**
The research paper explores the factors influencing user loyalty and subscription renewal in streaming applications in Indonesia using the UTAUT2 model. It identifies key variables such as content, performance expectations, and ethics, and highlights the importance of satisfaction and habit in user decision-making. The study provides valuable insights for streaming applications to enhance user experience, increase subscription renewals, and make informed decisions regarding expansion in the Indonesian market.
