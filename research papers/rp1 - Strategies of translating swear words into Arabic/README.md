- Abstract:
   "This study examines the translation strategies of swear words from English into Arabic in Netflix movie subtitles. A parallel corpus of English-Arabic movie subtitles was utilized to identify common swear words and analyze the translation strategies employed. The three main strategies observed were omission, softening, and swear-to-non-swear. The study found that the swear word 'shit' had the highest frequency of omission in the investigated data. By quantitatively analyzing the data, the researchers provide insights into the translation of swear words in audiovisual translation (AVT) and recommend further research on different AVT modes and swear words in various languages."
